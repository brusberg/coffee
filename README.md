# Rust Term Coffee

I wanted to create a little physics sim in the terminal using Rust. Started off with some steam coming off some coffee. Thank you to @elliot-wasem for some helping starting points.

Just need to `cargo build` and a `cargo run` in a zsh term (will work on other terminals when I get a chance to test). Looking to update to an ncurses window next.
